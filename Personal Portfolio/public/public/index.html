    <p> Hello, my name is Timi Folayan, and I am a sophomore transfer Software Engineering
    student with a passion for learning about machine learning and AI. I plan to complete my education at 
    Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends and family. I also enjoy playing video games
      and staying active. A fun fact about me is that I used to run track in high school, which instilled in me a love for staying fit and healthy. To this day, I maintain an active lifestyle by working out regularly. Whether it's hitting the gym, going for a run, or exploring new sports, staying active is a big part of my life.
